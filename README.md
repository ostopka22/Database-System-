# Database-System-
Through this bank database I was able to implement four different tables which are employee, company, account, and loan. 
These four tables allows the user to go into the database and find different option when entering a bank. 
Through my first menu option, I ask the user to enter an Employee ID, when this is entered, I am able to display at which bank and location the employee works at. 
This is a crucial option in a bank system, as it allows users to find specific employees based on their ID. 
My second option enters an account number to view the balance in the customers account and the loan of that account. 
This option is mostly used by the employee as the teller which is then able to tell the customer how much money they have left on their account and or if they have a loan take out on the amount. 
Option 3, which is similar to option 2 allows the user to deposit money into the bank or withdraw money from the bank. 
The balance is crucial as it tells the user how much money they have, again like option 2. 
Option 4 and 5 go simultaneously together as it allows the user to add and delete a record of an account. 
This option allows the employee to add a new banking customer into the system or when someone no longer wants to be affiliated with the company, they can also be taken out. 
Lastly, when the user is done with this database they are able to exit. Also, very important note, after every option, the menu is in a loop, which allows the user to right away choose a different option when the task is fulfilled.
